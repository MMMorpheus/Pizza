# Pizza
This is a client part of e-commerce app.
Tech stack:
1. React.js => main UI framework
2. SCSS => stylesheets
3. TypeScript
4. React-router-dom => client-side routing
5. Redux Toollit && asyncThunk => global app state and little part of using local storage
6. Axios => for server requests
7. React Content Loader => skeleton card while app status is "loading"
11. Some little helpers like uuid generator, debounced input, qs...

Backend => Mockapi.io

Near future plans: made a backend with custom responses, data pagination and sever storages for cart products, history of orders and thomething else..
Good luck to me!
